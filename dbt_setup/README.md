# DBT ( Data Build Tool )

Data Build Tool, is a open-source tool for transforming data directly from data warehouse.
* Why use DBT?
  * Modularity : DBT allows you to organize your transformation logic into modular, reusable components called `models`. This makes it easy to maintain and scale your data transformation processes as data grows and evolves.
  
  * Version Control : With DBT, transformation logic is stored as code, which can be version controlled using Git or other Version control system. 
  
  * Data Testing : DBT includes built-in support for writing and running data tests. These tests are helpful in ensuring the quality and integrity of the transformed data.
  
  * Documentation : DBT Automatically generates documentation for your data transformations, including descriptions of your models, columns, and tests. The document rendered is kept up to date with the code.
  
  * Incremental Builds : DBT only processes the data that has changed since the last run.
  
  * Native Integration : Integrates with data warehouses such as [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?hl=en "Google: BigQuery"), [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/data-warehouse/ "Snowflake : Data warehouse"), [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/redshift/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwltKxBhDMARIsAG8KnqX2x_yNzhITtIZAPF8Nk-P2rjzsVt8PNOulAJokt9c_C6ik6A-jH0gaApJCEALw_wcB&trk=fd773606-78e4-419c-b304-1d2223adc002&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwltKxBhDMARIsAG8KnqX2x_yNzhITtIZAPF8Nk-P2rjzsVt8PNOulAJokt9c_C6ik6A-jH0gaApJCEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!641559447509!e!!g!!amazon%20redshift!19256168393!150127766051 "AWS : Redshift") and other data warehousing platforms.

## Cloud Based Applications

## Cloud Native Applications

* [Cloud Native applications](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/cloud-native-application "cloud-native application: TechTarget - Ben Lutkevich") are developed entirely using cloud services, where both computation and hosting is done through services provided by the vendor. These applications are made to leverage the cloud specific features, rather than building an application for a particular platform.
* Cloud native applications tend to be loosely coupled,

  * [Loosely vs Tightely Coupled](https://cleancommit.io/blog/whats-the-difference-between-tight-and-loose-coupling/ "What's The Difference Between Tight And Loose Coupling? : Clean commit - Tim Davidson") : " In a loosely coupled system, the components are independent of each other"

    * **Advantages:** a loosely coupled system/ architecture each component has its own interface and communicates with other components through standardized protocols. And changes to one component
